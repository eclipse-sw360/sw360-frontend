# Eclipse SW360 Frontend

This project is aimed to replace the ancient [Eclipse SW360 Portal](https://eclipse.org/sw360) frontend, based on [Liferay Portal](https://liferay.dev)

Several reasons pushed this move:

* Hard maintenance for upgrades
* New lean technologies for frontend development
* Open up the codebase for a broad number of open source contributors that understand modern frontend technologies.
